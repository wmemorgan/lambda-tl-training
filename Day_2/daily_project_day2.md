## Part 1: Case Studies

---
### Case Study 1:
It's Week 2 and you've noticed one of your students, Tom Jerry, is very disengaged. Tom has not been attending guided projects and has been skipping stand-ups, and when they do attend, they have their camera off or are clearly demonstrating they aren't paying attention. 

1. Any questions you would want answered before taking action or additional information you might need
    STUDENT'S LAMBDA STORY:
    - What motivated him to attend Lambda? (Have him verbalize this in a 1:1, stand-up meeting, or slack channel)
    - LISTEN and take note
    - What is the outcome wants to have happen after he completes the Lambda program?
    - LISTEN and take note
    - What excites him about programming/DS/UX?
    - LISTEN and take note
2. What steps you would take
    - Reach out to him on slack and ask if everything is ok?
        - If he responds: follow-up with a 1 on 1 zoom meeting -> give SL a heads up that about conversation
            - Bring up his Lambda story and confirm if it aligns with his current behavior
            - LISTEN and take note
        - If he doesn't respond: -> escalate to SL
3. Any resources you might need
    - SL
    - Student success team member
4. What would success look like in this situation
    Success could be ONE of the following scenarios:
    a. Tom Jerry (re)engages in the Lambda program feeling better about the process and the support system available to him
    b. Tom Jerry pivots and leaves Lambda with greater clarity about life goals. 
5. What might the follow-up look like
    Depending on the situation:
    a. Assuming Tom is still at Lambda, give time in our Sprint 1-on-1s to check-in and see if his experience is still in alignment with his Lambda Story.
6. Any potential challenges that might arise and how you could address them
    Biggest risk factors:
    - This behavior might repeat itself due to lifestyle circumstances or reaction to stress from the program:
    - Follow-up with SL and Student Success team to devise a mitigation plan
    - Get clarity on my role in the mitigation plan

#### Part 2: 
Another student in your group comes to you and says Tom's behavior in stand-up is making them feel uncomfortable talking through their project.

1. Any questions you would want answered before taking action or additional information you might need
    - Get clarity and specificity on what is making the student uncomfortable
    - Give SL a heads up and let him/her know that about my issue response plan
2. What steps you would take
    - Reach out to Tom on slack and setup a 1-on-1 zoom meeting
    - Mention that his behavior is disruptive in the stand-up meeting and ask him if everything is ok.
    - LISTEN and take note
    - Revisit his Lambda story and confirm if his behavior supports or detracts from it
    - LISTEN and take note
    - Deliver verbal warning and re-assure that he can come to me separately if something is causing his disruptive behavior.
    - Inform SL about conversation
    ** IF NO RESOLUTION **
    - Follow TL escalation procedures
3. Any resources you might need
    - SL
    - Student success team member
4. What would success look like in this situation
    Success could be ONE of the following scenarios:
    a. If the student who made the complaint initially mis-interpreted Tom's behavior then clarification would change how that person reacts to it the behavior ceases to be disruptive thus harmony and productivity is restored.
    b. Tom ceases the disruptive behavior thus harmony and productivity is restored.
    c. Tom is no longer part of the group thus harmony and productivity is restored.
5. What might the follow-up look like
    - A few stand-up meetings after the problem is initially addressed check in with the student who made the complaint and confirm if the problem still exists.
    - Provide update to SL.
6. Any potential challenges that might arise and how you could address them
    Biggest risk factors:
    - This behavior might repeat itself due to lifestyle circumstances or reaction to stress from the program:
    - Follow-up with SL and Student Success team to devise a mitigation plan
    - Get clarity on my role in the mitigation plan

### Case Study 2:

You've noticed one of your students, Draco Malfoy, consistently tries to take over the group. They are disruptive in Slack and in stand-ups. They are consistently showing off, cutting other people off from talking, and they are very hard for others to work with in a group. Multiple students have reached out to you to say they are upset by Draco's behavior.

1. Any questions you would want answered before taking action or additional information you might need
Since this problem has occurred before I would need to get real clear on Lambda's escalation and conflict management protocol which should include the following:
    - What are the required steps when I see a student in violation of code conduct.
    - Recourse when student fails to comply with student conduct policies.
    - What will it take to remove the student from the group. It is not my job to change a student's personality or value system but I do feel a responsibilty for protecting the learning environment for the other students.

2. What steps you would take
    - Follow Lambda protocol regarding student conduct violation

3. Any resources you might need
    - Student conduct policy
    - SL
    - Student success team member
    - Lambda disciplinary team member

4. What would success look like in this situation
    Success could be ONE of the following scenarios:
    a. The behavior ceases
    b. Draco Malfoy is gone from the group 

5. What might the follow-up look like
    Following up with SL and Lambda team to expedite the removal of Draco Malfoy from the group

6. Any potential challenges that might arise and how you could address them
    - Behavior could repeat itself -> Escalate to have Draco removed

### Case Study 3:
You are finishing up a Sprint Challenge 1:1 review with one of your students. The student did not meet MVP for their sprint challenge, and you notice they seem to be taking the news very hard. In talking through the situation with the student, they reveal to you that they have been struggling with mental health concerns, feeling very overwhelmed, and are burnt out.

Escalate this immediately to my SL and ask for intervention from Lambda team members that are qualified to handle these types of issues.

4. What would success look like in this situation
- Student gets the support s/he needs

---
### Case study 4:
You are reviewing a student's code/project, and you are fairly positive they plagiarized.

1. Any questions you would want answered before taking action or additional information you might need
    - What are the required steps when I see a student in violation of code conduct.

2. What steps you would take
    - Inform SL of my suspicions and get any feedback/tips on how to investigate
    - Schedule 1-on-1 with student and have them walk me through their code

3. Any resources you might need
    - Lambda handbook
    - SL
    - Lambda code violation response team member

4. What would success look like in this situation
    - Situation has been dealt with quickly and in a fair manner

5. What might the follow-up look like
    - Any feedback/tips/refresher from SL or Lambda code violatation response team member on addressing plagarism

6. Any potential challenges that might arise and how you could address them
    - Mistakenly accuse a student of plagarism.
        - Mitigate by bringing in Lambda incident response resources ASAP and letting them handle mitigation

### Case 5
You've noticed one of your students who is on the quieter side does a phenomenal job - consistently completes assignments and stretch goals, but will not participate in the group or speak-up in channels or during stand-up.

My stand-ups are structured where we go around the room and everyone has to provide a status update.

1. Any questions you would want answered before taking action or additional information you might need

    - What is their background:
        - Where are they from?
        - What is their work history?
    - What motivated him to attend Lambda? (Have him verbalize this in a 1:1, stand-up meeting, or slack channel)
    - LISTEN and take note
    - What is the outcome wants to have happen after he completes the Lambda program?
    - LISTEN and take note
    - What excites him about programming/DS/UX?
    - LISTEN and take note

        - If he responds: follow-up with a 1 on 1 zoom meeting -> give SL a heads up that about conversation
            - Bring up his Lambda story and confirm if it aligns with his current behavior
            - LISTEN and take note
        - If he doesn't respond: -> escalate to SL and bring Lambda Student Success team into the process
3. Any resources you might need
    - SL
    - Student success team member
4. What would success look like in this situation
    Student begins participating in group discussion
5. What might the follow-up look like
    - Give time in our Sprint 1-on-1s to check-in and see if his experience is still in alignment with his/her Lambda Story.
6. Any potential challenges that might arise and how you could address them
    - Student could revert to previous behavior
        - Follow-up with SL and Student Success team to devise a mitigation plan
        - Get clarity on my role in the mitigation plan

### Case 6
A student comes to you, very clearly upset, and reports that they feel they were being harassed or discriminated against by another student.

Escalate this immediately to my SL and ask for intervention from Lambda team members that are qualified to handle these types of issues.

4. What would success look like in this situation
- Student gets the support s/he needs
